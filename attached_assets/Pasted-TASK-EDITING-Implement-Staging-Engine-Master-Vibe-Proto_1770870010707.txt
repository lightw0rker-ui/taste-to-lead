TASK: EDITING - Implement Staging Engine & Master Vibe Protocol

We are editing the project to add the "Staging Engine" logic. I need you to create two files. Please write the code exactly as described below to ensure strict adherence to our "Vibe Bible" and "Budget Safety" protocols.

FILE 1: Create or Overwrite 'prompts.py' with this EXACT content:
(This file defines our immutable design laws)

```python
# prompts.py - THE VIBE BIBLE & MASTER PROTOCOL

# 1. THE VISION INSTRUCTION (The Eye)
# This forces Gemini to see the room like a structural engineer, not a poet.
ARCHITECT_PROMPT = """
ACT AS: A Senior Interior Architect and 3D Renderer.

TASK: Analyze the provided image of an empty room and generate a strict execution prompt for an image generation model (like Imagen or Stable Diffusion).

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE PHYSICS
- Identify the FLOORING material (e.g., "White Oak Herringbone", "Polished Concrete").
- Identify the LIGHT SOURCE (e.g., "Soft diffused sunlight from large bay window on left").
- Identify the PERSPECTIVE (e.g., "Eye-level wide shot", "Two-point perspective").
- Identify the NEGATIVE SPACE (Where is the floor empty? That is where furniture goes).

STEP 2: APPLY THE VIBE
- Apply the following design language: "{style}"
- Select furniture pieces that match this vibe EXACTLY.

STEP 3: GENERATE THE OUTPUT
Write a single, continuous prompt string using this exact template. Do not add intro text.

TEMPLATE:
"A photorealistic [Perspective] of an empty [Room Type] now staged with [Vibe Name] furniture. The room features [Flooring] and [Architectural Details].
CENTRAL FOCUS: A [Key Furniture Piece] positioned in the [Negative Space], facing the [Focal Point].
DETAILS: [List 3 specific decor items from Vibe].
LIGHTING: [Light Source] creating [Mood] shadows.
QUALITY: Architectural Digest photography, 8k resolution, highly detailed textures, ray-tracing, depth of field."

}

FILE 2: Create or Overwrite 'staging_engine.py'
(This is the execution script with the Budget Gate)
Import google.generativeai, os, and the local prompts file.
Configure the API using os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY'].
Initialize the gemini-1.5-flash model (Low cost model).
Create a function analyze_room(image_path, target_vibe) that:
Reads the image file.
Retrieves the specific vibe description from prompts.STYLES.
Formats the prompts.ARCHITECT_PROMPT with that vibe.
Sends the image + the formatted prompt to Gemini.
Returns the text response.
Create a main execution block that:
Sets a variable image_file = "test_room.jpg".
Checks if the file exists.
Runs analyze_room using the "Industrialist" style (as a test).
PRINTS the resulting prompt to the console so I can read it.
CRITICAL STEP: Adds an input check: input("💰 Do you want to generate this image? (yes/no): ").
If 'yes', print "Simulating Image Gen..."
If 'no', print "Aborted to save budget."
Execute this now.
